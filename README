XCode 4 Project Template for fullscreen switching
by Sebastian Volland

Switching to fullscreen and back on a Mac is a bit tricky, especially
if you don't use OpenGL and also want to switch to a lower display
resolution.

There is a bunch of sample code available on the net, but I didn't
find a full sample project, so here is one.

This project consists of a window with one button: "Toggle
Fullscreen". If you click this button, the display resolution is
switched to 640x480x16 and you see the application window taking up
the entire screen. On multi-monitor setups, the first screen is used.
Clicking the button again or quitting the application restores the
display resolution.
